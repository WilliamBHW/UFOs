# UFOs
## Overview
This project is aimed to construct a website that will display UFO informations such as date, country, shape, comment etc. While with informations provided, have filter criterias beside and apply user inputed filters under each category. The language used for website construction and filter is consist of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

## Background
>Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
By entering keywords into the filter search table, the website is able to construct new filter criterias and provide filtered information. Any changes to filter will be automatically applied after an input. For instance, by appling date as "1/13/2010" will return filter results on january 13th, 2010 only.
###### Filtered Information
In this case, the information is displayed based on date only.

If the input have not recognized certain value or the value does not exist, website will respond with no  info displayed.
###### Filter With No Display

## Summary
Although the website can be seen after downloaded the files, it is more convinient to see it right away. It is a good idea to hide the ```.html``` code and display the website in GitHub directly. On the other hand, it would be a good idea to provide a button that will refresh the page and clear all data incase users get lost with their inputs. The comment seems taken from random descriptions of non-specialist. Although the data on other criterias are being precise, including live testimonies and images would be a great improvement.
